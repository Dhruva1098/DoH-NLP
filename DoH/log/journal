The books i decided to go with are: Kafka : letters to milena, the castle | Sylvia Plath : the Journals of Sylvia Plath 
Also i would require books by writers who were not depressed -or- happy. I want books written as a diary or journals. But for now i am pretty much out of luck with what to choose. 

Moreover, i simply cannot use a BOW model as this case requires context. A n-gram model would be nice but i still have no idea what 'n' would be.
Also cleaning the data would again, be a challenge. As using stemming might hurt model. 
ALSO- kafka wrote in german so books by him are translated. Sulvia plath however wrote in english so big relief. 

I am open to ideas, also open to books i should take as + input.

Something i realised, a naive bayes model could be useful. either that or neural network. Because therotically it works on same principle as n-grams. Also, i have no idea what n shoudld be.
I'll start from 2 and go to 5-6. That will probably increase complexity of my model, but i've got all the time in the world. 
I'll also try to apple the BOW model if it works (i doubt tho), if it does, than thats really good for us. I'll also keep track of time taken by different n grams and how acceuracy scales with it.
