The books i decided to go with are: Kafka : letters to milena, the castle | Sylvia Plath : the Journals of Sylvia Plath 
Also i would require books by writers who were not depressed -or- happy. I want books written as a diary or journals. But for now i am pretty much out of luck with what to choose. 

Moreover, i simply cannot use a BOW model as this case requires context. A n-gram model would be nice but i still have no idea what 'n' would be.
Also cleaning the data would again, be a challenge. As using stemming might hurt model. 
ALSO- kafka wrote in german so books by him are translated. Sulvia plath however wrote in english so big relief. 

I am open to ideas, also open to books i should take as + input.
